    "# Web Scrapping BWF Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by Loh Kean Yew's historic achievement of being the first Singaporean to win a BWF World Championships title at the BWF World Championships 2021 held in Huelva, Spain, I wanted to do some simple analysis on his meteoric rise to the top of the badminton world.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start off, I felt that the BWF official website offers some match data that could be useful. Since I have just learnt about web scrapping, I decided to code and web scrape Loh Kean Yew's playing data from the BWF website."

    "## Using Selenium\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start, I was looking for tools to perform the web scrapping as the BWF website seemed to be quite complex. Unlike the tutorials where I practised on HTML sites, it seemed like the BWF site is also written in Javascript? While I have limited knowledge in web development, HTML and Javascript, a few google searches got me to Selenium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selenium as a powerful tool for controlling web browsers through programs and performing browser automation. It is able to perform various operations on multiple elements on a webpage. This is required as the BWF website is coded with buttons/tabs that changes the info dynamically on the page without changing the URL. Again, not the expert on web development so more work needs to be done to better understand."
